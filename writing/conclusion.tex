\label{ch:conclusion}

The continued interest in the study of community structures of complex networks has resulted in a multitude of approaches to the problem. Genetic algorithms have proved themselves to be effective in dealing with optimization problems by levering biologically inspired operators to explore a large search space. While GAs are a fairly under represented class of algorithms in the community detection literature, that by no means they are not worth further investigation.

In this work, four GAs for the community detection problem were selected and implemented as described in their respective publications. Using several parameter sets for each, as proposed in each paper and as selected for this work, their results were compared over a battery of input data.
We presented two classes of well understood benchmarks, GN, and LFR. By knowing the community structure of each example graph, a direct comparison of performance is able to be made between each approach. For both cases, we show that each algorithm can detect the structure of networks with a reasonable degree of accuracy, with those algorithms using local search and guided initialization methods outperforming the others.
